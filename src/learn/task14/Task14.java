     * 4. In the loop it asks you to enter a command ('d', 'n', 'e')

     * if the index was wrong - display an error message
     * 6. When 'n' was entered, the program asks you to enter an index of the number (0-3) and displays a corresponding number from the array;
     * if the index was wrong - display an error message
     * 7. When 'e' was entered - finish the program
