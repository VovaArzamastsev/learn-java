     * 4. Start a 'for(int i = ...)' cycle that asks you to enter numbers - read them and put into the array
     * 5. When the array is full - display the numbers from the array in the format:
     *              numbers[0] = <num0>
     *              numbers[1] = <num1>

     * Hint: use the ScannerUtil to read numbers
