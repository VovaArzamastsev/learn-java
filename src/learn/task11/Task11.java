     * Write a program that:
     * 1. Asks the user to enter the size of array of numbers
     * 2. Creates the array of numbers with the size from step 1
     * 3. Enters an endless while loop
     * 4. In the loop it asks the user to enter a number and puts it into the array of numbers
     * 5. If the user entered 100 (code number), the program prints all numbers and finishes
     * 6. If the array is full and the user enters the number that is not 100 (code number) - write an error message that array is full
     *
     * Hint: to solve the task you need to create an additional 'int index = 0' before the loop,
     * and update it inside the loop when the number is added into the array, this 'index' helps you understand if there is still free space in the array
